// readiness. It is intended for sequential connection bootstrap and subsequent
// EOF observation, not concurrent reads/writes or ordinary bulk/message
// traffic. There is one reusable transfer slot and no worker, retry timer, or
// idle polling. Every method is serialized with poll on the proactor's owner
// thread (including before the first poll). Callers marshal cross-thread
// requests themselves.

// POSIX requires a connected, nonblocking AF_UNIX SOCK_STREAM descriptor (for

//
// Send completion does NOT establish import completion. In particular, Windows
// transmits source handle values for peer-side duplication. Source handles must
// remain stable until the caller's higher-level import acknowledgement. POSIX
// attaches SCM_RIGHTS only until the first successful byte is sent.

// ownership of the complete resource bundle to the caller. Failure closes every
// acquired local resource and leaves all outputs NONE; data may contain a
// partial prefix.
//
// EOF before the byte extent completes reports OUT_OF_RANGE. Receiving one byte
// with zero resources can therefore monitor peer closure after bootstrap.
// Unexpected data is then a protocol violation for the caller to interpret.
// POSIX receives ancillary data on every fragment, including
// overflow/truncation cleanup. Windows duplicates noninheritable handles from
