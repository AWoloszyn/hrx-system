// Transport-independent peer session lifecycle.
//
// A session connects or adopts one connection, exchanges bootstrap peer
// information on endpoint ordinal 0, and hands that endpoint to the control
// DATA/GOAWAY/ERROR protocol. Remaining endpoint ordinals are opened directly
// by the application in matching order on both peers.
//
// The session owns no HAL state, frontier proxies, transport carrier, timeout,
// or callback ledger. Connection deactivation is the callback retirement
// boundary. The callback user data and all application endpoint callback
// targets must remain valid until on_deactivated returns.
